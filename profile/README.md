## Kubernetes Workshops

_Immersive, hands-on, and fully remote_

Don't waste your time and money on monotonous, canned training delivered by freshmen hires. SuperOrbital delivers outstanding results each and every time.

We don't believe in static, podium-based training. Instead, SuperOrbital courses immerse your team in an active learning environment where they internalize the lessons through collaboration and hands-on workshops. The end result is knowledge that sticks, and a foundation for true expertise.

> "This is the best quality technical training I've ever attended."
> -- happy student

We provide a curriculum that covers everything your team needs to go from zero to Kubernetes expert. We tailor each workshop to your team's situation and needs, and we're happy to create custom chapters.
